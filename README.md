# LinkedList

# Linked List Review

We did this by:

Defining a Node class to hold the values and links between nodes
Implementing a LinkedList class to handle external operations on the list like adding and removing nodes
Instructions
Feel free to play around a bit with your code. Here are some ideas:

Create a few nodes and adding them to a new linked list
Print your linked list out by using your stringify_list() method
Remove your linked list’s head node
Print your list again — was your original head node removed?
So far you’ve built a method to remove the first occurrence of a given value. How do you think you would remove all nodes that have a specific value? Try building a method to do that!
